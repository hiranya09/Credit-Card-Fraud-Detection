# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
# Overview 
 The goal of this research is to employ machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.  We used a variety of models to efficiently classify fraudulent transactions while reducing false positives because fraud detection datasets are extremely unbalanced.  Transaction details with attributes like money, time, and anonymous variables produced via PCA are included in the dataset utilized for this study.
